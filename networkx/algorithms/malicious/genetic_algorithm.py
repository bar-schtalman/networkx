def GA(G1, G2, ALPHA):
    """
    Since subgraph isomorphism is an NP-hard problem, a
    GA is appropriate. A GA generates a set of initial solutions
    and lets them evolve over a number of iterations. When GA
    meets some condition, the best solution is returned and the
    algorithm terminates. Our algorithm replaces 20 percent
    of the population per generation and uses local optimisation heuristics after mutation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G1 : NetworkX DiGraph
        A (dirceted) graph 
    G2 : NetworkX DiGraph
        A (dirceted) graph 
    ALPHA: folat
        A threshold value that indicates how much similar the ftness' score should be

    Returns
    -------
    True iff the minimal fitness' score between all the subgraphs og G1 and G2 it smaller than the given alpha 

    Notes
    -----
    In computer science and operations research, 
    a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by 
    the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger
    class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). 
    Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality
    solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on 
    biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.
