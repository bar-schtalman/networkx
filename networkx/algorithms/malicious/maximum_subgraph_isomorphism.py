    """
    Finding the number of edges in the maximum subgraph isomorphism on two given (directed) graphs: G1 and G2.
    The function returns the number of edges of the maximum subgraph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G1 : NetworkX DiGraph
        This graph will be compare to all G2's subgraphs
    G2 : NetworkX DiGraph
        All Its subgraphs will be compared to G1 

    Returns
    -------
    G2_tag : NetworkX DiGraph
        The number of edges of the maximum subgraph G2' that isomorphic to G1

    Notes
    -----
    The problem of maximum subgraph isomorphism is to find
    G_S = (V_S, E_S) which satisfies subgraph isomorphism to G
    if there exists a subgraph G_S âŠ‚ G = (V,E) while maximizing
    |E_S|/|E|.

    Example 1: finding the maximum subgraph isomorphism on two graphs (trivial)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    >>> import networkx as nx

    # creates and builds G1 
    >>> G1 = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G1.add_nodes_from(range(1, 5))
    >>> G1.add_edges_from([(1, 2),(2, 3),(3, 4),(4, 1)])

    # creates and builds G2 
    >>> G2 = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G2.add_nodes_from(range(1,5))
    >>> G2.add_edges_from([(1, 2),(2, 3),(3, 4),(4, 1),(1, 3),(2, 4)])

    # creates and builds G2_tag
    >>> G2_tag = G1

    >>> find_max__edges_of_sub_isomorphism_graph(G1, G2)

    Example 2: finding the maximum subgraph isomorphism on two graphs (non trivial)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # creates and builds G3 
    >>> G3 = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G3.add_nodes_from(range(1, 7))
    >>> edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3)]
    >>> G3.add_edges_from(edges)

    # creates and builds G4 
    >>> G4 = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G4.add_nodes_from(range(1, 15))
    >>> edges = [(1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 7), (5, 8), (5, 10), (10, 10)]
    >>> G4.add_edges_from(edges)

    # creates and builds G4_tag
    >>> G4_tag = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G4_tag.add_nodes_from(range(1, 6))
    >>> G4_tag.add_node(7)
    >>> edges = [(1, 4), (4, 7), (3, 5)]
