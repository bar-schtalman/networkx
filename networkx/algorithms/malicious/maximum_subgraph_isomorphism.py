def find_max_sub_isomorphism_graph(G1, G2):
    """
    Finding the maximum subgraph isomorphism on two given (directed) graphs: G1 and G2.
    The function returns the maximum subgraph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G1 : NetworkX DiGraph
        G2 will compare its subgraphs to this (dirceted) dependency graph
    G2 : NetworkX DiGraph
        All Its subgraphs will be compared to G1 

    Returns
    -------
    G2_tag : NetworkX DiGraph
        A maximum subgraph of G2 that isomorphic to G1

    Notes
    -----
    The problem of maximum subgraph isomorphism is to find
    G_S = (V_S, E_S) which satisfies subgraph isomorphism to G
    if there exists a subgraph G_S âŠ‚ G = (V,E) while maximizing
    |E_S|/|E|.
