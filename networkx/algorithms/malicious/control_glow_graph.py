def build_control_graph(semantic_program):
    """Converting a given program's code with semantic meaning to a control flow graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    program : string
        A path to the file that contains the semantic code

    Returns
    -------
    control_flow_graph : NetworkX Graph
        A graph that represents the flow of the code.    

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXPathDoesNotExist
        If the given path does not exist.

    Notes
    -----
    A control-flow graph (CFG) is a representation, using graph notation,
    of all paths that might be traversed through a program during its execution.
