def find_subgraph_isomorphism_with_genetic_algorithm(G1, G2, ALPHA):
    """
    Since subgraph isomorphism is an NP-hard problem, a
    GA is appropriate. A GA generates a set of initial solutions
    and lets them evolve over a number of iterations. When GA
    meets some condition, the best solution is returned and the
    algorithm terminates. Our algorithm replaces 20 percent
    of the population per generation and uses local optimisation heuristics after crossover and mutation (hybrid or
    memetic GA).

    Improving runtime
    -----------------
    The find_subgraph_isomorphism_with_genetic_algorithm function uses multiprocessing to improve its runtime.
    multiprocessing distributes the computation across multiple cores.
    This optimization allow for faster execution of the algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G1 : NetworkX DiGraph
        A (dirceted) graph
    G2 : NetworkX DiGraph
        A (dirceted) graph
    ALPHA: folat
        A threshold value that indicates how much similar the ftness' score should be

    Returns
    -------
    True iff the minimal fitness' score between all the subgraphs of G1 and G2 it smaller than the given alpha

    Notes
    -----
    In computer science and operations research,
    a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by
    the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger
    class of evolutionary algorithms (EA).
    Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality
    solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on
    biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.
